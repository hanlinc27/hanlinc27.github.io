# üê¨hanlin personal website

### Built with: 
* Gatsby 
* GraphQL
* React.js, React Hooks, React Helmet
* Typescript
* Javascript
* HTML/CSS

### üß† Quick Start with this Website as Template

1. __Create a local Gatsby site by cloning the dev branch and using the Gatsby CLI.__
```
gatsby new project https://github.com/hanlinc27/hanlinc27.github.io.git
```
2. __Run on the local environment to start developing.__
```
cd project
gatsby develop
```
3. __Add and make your own changes!üòÄ
You can view the site locally at `<http://localhost:8000>` and query through `<http://localhost:8000>` 

4.__Deploying on Github__ 
I deployed my site through using the gh-pages [package!](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/) but you can also use Netlify

### Learning More with Gatsby
Gatsby's documentation was all well written and easy to follow along. Pretty much most of what you can do can be described [here!](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) 

### Future Tasks 
* Writing more posts in the musings section
* Have a dynamic animated dolphin footer
* Set up querying for the Recently section instead of manually encoding

### Thank you! 
I started with the Ueno Gatsby [Starter!](https://github.com/ueno-llc/ueno-gatsby-starter). This project is licensed under the MIT [License!](https://github.com/ueno-llc/ueno-gatsby-starter) 

I guess the goal here is to learn a bit more while trying to communicate in a better manner? and trying the markdown rendering in gatsby :)
